## Overview
This is my personal log for [Kaggle playground competition S4E7](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e7), in which I got the **256-th** place out of 2234 teams (__TOP 12%__). It was my first participation in Kaggle Competition.

* The objective of this competition is to predict which customers respond positively to an automobile insurance offer by using binary classification.
* The main challenge was, in my personal opinion, to overcome the highly imbalanced(almost 90% of 0s and 10% of 1s in the label variable) distribution of the dataset.
* Note that the dataset for this competition is not uploaded. If you need, please visit [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e7/data).

I would like to express my gratitude to my teammate `Forever_YW`(kaggle id) for his invaluable support and collaboration throughout this Kaggle competition.
